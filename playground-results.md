Title : Flowise: How to chat with your PDF using no-code UI Framework
Transcript :
hello everyone today we were talking about two examples how to use flow wise here is the fluency UI and there's also one Public public example in the marketplace as you can see here um all the examples they gave and how we can build the chat box and how to interact with the open Ai and here's the third party API and also how to use Vector DP if you are interested in it you can click any of this and build your own chat box so today we will use two examples to show how to build a launcher mode or user flow wise here is the main design board and if we click on this button we can see all the components here there's a agent the chain and the chat models also large language model API and also we have the vector DP here we have a caroma pine coin so first let's get started and build one very simple um chat back just open here API so we need to firstly 19 angle model we use open Ai and we also need one prompt so we need the prompt template here and after that we need a writer to combine these two together that would be the chain not the language model chain so here firstly we can connect them together like the open Ai and then the prompt here yeah that's the chatback component and after that we can we can give them open AI key so here is the open AI key and also we have the prompt template we need to give them template format they also give they'll really give one example what is a good name for your company that makes product the product is a very variable that user input so instead we can use
another template like give an name for a school that teaches some kind of courses so let's save it after that we also need to format The Prompt by news there was really one example so let's put ours so the variable for our case is the causes and the input would be here is the question so we can use the question here then let's save it and then after that I think that would be it before we get into interact with the open AI we need to save this chat flow let's see it's test hello wise one let's save
it and we can input any here let's see it's for dancing like for example give a name for school that teaches dancing so let's get started Dance Academy of the art okay
that's pretty cool cooking Gourmet Academy or teacher films so Silver Screen Academy I think that's a pretty good name okay this is the first example very basic example to how to use a flow wise but mostly if we want to to the use the long chain or the flow wise we want to interact with our local data no matter it's PDF word or Json data so the next example I will build is for how to using the how to use the flow wise interactive with the PDF data so let's get into a new design so here would it be so before we get into this example we need to um input the data input the PDF data so the first module would be data loader so here are different types of data loader and for our case we use the PDF downloader so this is the PW data loader after we have the PDF the next thing we want to do is split the data into different chunks so we
can use the text super leader we choose the recursive character tag simulator after we have different chunks of data of information what we will do next is use the embedding right so the next step we will do is use the embedding as we can see here are different embeddings but for my case I will choose hacking face embedding because your PDF might be very large like a few hundreds of pages you don't want to use the open AI embedding because that will introduce some free instead I would use a hugging
phase and also if you are not familiar with this you can use a hugging phase embedding to play around first after you have the embedding you want to save the embed into the Visa DB so and the Victory DB will do semantic search right so the next thing we want to choose is Vector DB we can choose chroma or pine cone because I already have the pine core account I'm going to choose Panko and also I want to mention that you can also use the PT Vector that is post degree free version in DB um what a pine
cone or water Vector DB is doing here is um it is an database to save the embedding so every time when the user inquiry is some questions they will do semantic search they would find the similarity in the knowledge base and the fund them similar content and send it to open AI or any large language model API and do your task so here the next stuff wind can have is large language models for example we have open AI here so this is a key component how we can interact with our local PDF so before we get
into the next step we need to know we need to use one wrapper to combine them together so the rifle of course will be that language chain so we put the retrieval q q a
chain here and we can connect them together so firstly the Texas leader and I have to die then the document will be into different chunks then afterwards the embedding
will do the embedding and save the data into the pine cone so the pine cone should be connected to the vector DB and the open AI obviously is the knowledge and language model so the next step will be the input file so the input file is a survey of large language model this is a one of the latest application for large language model survey and we use it as our PDF so we can do the search in this PDF so we upload the PDF for example I already have it here we just upload it and afterwards we need the API key for hacking face so let's input a hug and face API key and we also need to input the open AI API key so if you don't have openai API key you can go to their website and API key but now in my I charge you something that's a very minimum and also here is the pine cone API key we need to input the Pinecone API key you can go to their website and I put the one I will put the link in the video below so the Pinecone environment this is the environment where they hosted their server so the Pinecone
environment you can also get this one in their website once you get in the index name I would like to see flow wise so I think that's yeah let's save the example test flow wise two this second example so let's do one search so let's find something in the publication and the search so okay ever since the touring test was proposed in 1950s we can say Turing test yeah it might take some time because they need to uh save the embedding into the Pinecone DB and I think after that the first time it would it will take some time okay then they searched touring test tuning test is mentioned in reference 3 which is touring compute intelligence in reference three let's go to
reference three to see if this is referencing oh nice so they can then figure out the tuning test and they can also see in the reference three this is actually amazing
right uh yeah like Computing machinery and intelligence Computing machinery and intelligence that's cool I don't I don't even know the reference here the help has figured out and this is a 99 language model nama to see what they can provide for us Nama what is that oh it's kind of like also in the reference okay necessarily see this one let's search it's a reference called Lama okay here is Nama open and efficient fundamental model wow so this is the example for the flow-wise so if you if you are from JavaScript by JavaScript background I highly recommend you take a look into this um flowwise project because it's um very very handy first of all and then you can also contribute to them the repo and if you have very strong JavaScript or if you want Lauren JavaScript web or do any AI application this is a a very good project for you this is another project like long flow but that is building on top of python so for anyone who interested in building python application you can go to the nonflow I would like to see this is a very good project for for us and channel we will constantly upload some tutorial for large language model training and inference and also optimization and we and we will also do some Hands-On coding for the 90 language model if you're interested in any of this topic you can subscribe

The video is about using Flowise, a no-code UI framework, to chat with PDF files. The speaker demonstrates two examples of how to use Flowise: building a simple chat bot and interacting with PDF data.

Building a Simple Chat Bot:
To build the chat bot, the speaker starts by connecting components like OpenAI and prompts in the design board. They provide an example prompt template for users to input their own questions. The speaker also explains how to format the prompt by adding variables and inputs. After saving the flow, they show an example conversation where they ask for a name for a school that teaches dancing.

Interacting with PDF Data:
For interacting with PDF data, the first step is loading the data using a PDF loader module. Then, text super leader is used to split the data into chunks. Next, hugging face embedding is used because it's more efficient for large PDFs compared to open AI embedding.
The embedded data is then saved into Vector DB (pine cone) which allows semantic search in knowledge bases.
Finally, large language models like OpenAI are integrated into the flow using a retrieval QA chain wrapper.

Questions:
1. What are two examples shown in this video?
2. How do you connect components in Flowise?
3. What does hugging face embedding offer for processing large PDFs?
4.What does Vector DB (pine cone) allow you to do?

Answers:
1. Two examples shown in this video are building a simple chat bot and interacting with PDF data.
2.You can connect components by linking them together on the design board.
3.Hugging face embedding offers better efficiency when working with large PDfs compared to open AI embedding.
4.Vector DB (pine cone) allows semantic search in knowledge bases
